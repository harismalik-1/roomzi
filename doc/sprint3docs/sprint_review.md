# Roomzi/Driven Dev

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sunday July 20, 2025
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

We have allocated work appropriately and the features have been installed properly.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

The decision to merge everyone’s copy then testing it at the end. We should have tested after every merge.

#### Planned changes

A few bug fixes in our existing features, ie. profile creation, rent tracking, etc…



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
Creation of profile for landlord.
Creation of profile for tenant
Rent tracking
Maintenance of request 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

None

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

As mentioned earlier, standardized approach to development will help us produce uniform code with minimal merge conflicts 
Instead of using RAW sql queries we will use PRISMA ORM for better security and readability and extensibility of queries 
We observed some bugs in the code during the recent demo. Our plan is to prioritize and resolve these concerns in the upcoming iteration.
