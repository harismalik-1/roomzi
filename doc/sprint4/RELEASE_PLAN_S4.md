## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability

**Priority**: High - Critical for user experience and platform adoption

**Implementation Focus**:

- **Page Persistence**: Maintain user state when reloading or navigating away from pages
- **Form Completion**: Prevent data loss during form submission processes
- **Navigation Consistency**: Ensure users remain on the same page after actions

**Trade-offs**:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Page persistence requires state storage and retrieval, potentially increasing load times
2. **Security Concerns**: Storing form data in local storage increases security risks on shared devices

### Scalability

**Priority**: High - Essential for supporting concurrent users and growing data volumes

**Implementation Focus**:

- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting to manage Supabase request limits
- **Query Optimization**: Pagination and filtering for efficient data handling
- **Concurrent User Support**: Architecture supporting multiple simultaneous users

**Trade-offs**:

1. **Rate Limiting vs User Experience**: Prevents API overload but may cause delays during high traffic
2. **Query Complexity vs Performance**: Efficient data handling requires more complex query logic

### Reliability

**Priority**: High - Critical for consistent user experience and platform trust

**Implementation Focus**:

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for failed operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning during partial failures
