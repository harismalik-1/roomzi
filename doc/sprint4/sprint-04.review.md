# Roomzi/Driven Dev

## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sunday, August 3, 2025
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Clearly listed each team member’s tasks at the start of the sprint
  * Each team member knew exactly what features and tasks to work on for the duration of the sprint
  * There was no confusion on who was working what task
* Planned standups on the final two days of the sprint
  * Instead of planning an equal amount of time between each standup, we had a standup every other day for the majority of the sprint, with one standup on each of the final two days
  * Having standups on two consecutive days at the end of the sprint helped us prepare for our final demo

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Relying on verbal updates without feature demonstrations during standups
  * This lead to the team overlooking some issues with features and allowed misinterpretations to continue
* Starting testing at the end of the sprint
  * As our development was delayed, all tasks that were left to the end, including testing, were rushed

#### Planned changes

* If we were going into another iteration, we would:
  * More thoroughly review each task’s updates in our standup meetings to make more informed decisions about our next steps
  * Have a detailed discussion about each feature’s requirements in our sprint meeting

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Complete AI Integration in chat feature: https://roomzi.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-7 
* Add interactive map of listings: https://roomzi.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-2

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Complete all development work by Tuesday July 29th or Wednesday July 30th
  * By this deadline, we came across some fixes that delayed the completion of our development

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* If we were going into another iteration, our key takeaways would be:
  * Be more thorough when planning tasks and features, ensuring all team members are on the same page
  * Continue refining our organization strategies for smoother workflows
