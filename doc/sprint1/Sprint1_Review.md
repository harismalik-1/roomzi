## Process Retrospective

### ‚úÖ What Went Well

The following process-oriented decisions significantly contributed to team efficiency and effectiveness:

- **Clearly Defined Roles:** Team members had a clear understanding of their responsibilities, minimizing confusion and boosting productivity.
- **Platform Decision:** Choosing a web application over a mobile app reduced development complexity and accelerated delivery.
- **Supabase Integration:** Supabase provided essential tools with ease of use, streamlining backend development.
- **Daily Standups:** These meetings enhanced accountability and helped swiftly remove blockers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

Some decisions did not yield the expected results and will be reconsidered in future iterations:

- **Lack of Monitoring Thresholds:** Absence of defined rate-limiting measures led to recurring 429 errors.
- **Mid-Sprint Scope Shift:** Changing priorities midway caused workflow disruptions and reduced effectiveness.
- **Auth Setup Challenges:** The initial implementation of authentication was inefficient, leading to last-minute changes using Supabase Auth.

### üîÅ Planned Process Changes

To address the above challenges and improve future performance, the team plans to:

- **Manage Rate Limits Strategically:** Avoid simultaneous implementation testing to prevent throttling.
- **Standardize Codebase Structure:** Align on a consistent folder and file structure to reduce merge conflicts.
- **Clarify Scope & Metrics:** Establish well-defined objectives to minimize wasted effort and optimize output.
