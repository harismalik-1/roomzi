## Process Retrospective

### ‚úÖ What Went Well

The following process-oriented decisions significantly contributed to team efficiency and effectiveness:

- **Sprint Scope Planning:** A lighter workload allowed the team to focus on significant bug fixes, which in turn strengthened our features.
- **Improved Documentation Practices:** We efficiently managed documentation creation, ensuring all documents were completed ahead of schedule.
- **Tasks Assignment:** We had two people work on each feature to ensure faster completion and reduced risk.
- **Daily Standups:** These meetings enhanced accountability and helped swiftly remove blockers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

Some decisions did not yield the expected results and will be reconsidered in future iterations:

- **Merging Decisions:** Merging all branches without individual testing introduced multiple issues.
- **Miscommunication:** Some tasks led to redundant implementations, which limited the number of distinct features we could showcase.
- **Roadmap Issues:** Some tasks were created without addressing necessary prerequisites, leading to the use of mock or altered data.

### üîÅ Planned Process Changes

To address the above challenges and improve future performance, the team plans to:

- **Thoroughly Test After Each Merge:** We can avoid large bug fixes by ensuring the code compiles properly after every merge.
- **Discuss Final Design:** Confirm that every feature task contributes to a differentiated outcome.
- **Analyze Necessary Components:** Define the essential functionalities required for optimal feature performance.

## Key Takeaways for Next Iteration

- **Centralized Communication:** To prevent feature overlap, we'll ensure proper communication on all development plans.
- **Clarified Goals:** Outline all necessary components for feature creation to avoid omissions.
- **Bug Resolution:** Bugs identified during the demo will be triaged and addressed as a top priority in the next sprint.
